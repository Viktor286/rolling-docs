# 3_Technical_Plan.md: Space Travel Booking Platform ðŸš€

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical strategy, architecture, and standards for developing the Space Travel Booking Platform, as defined in `2_Project_Description.md`. It serves as the core technical reference for all contributors working within the RollingDocs framework. All technical implementations must align with this plan unless explicitly overridden by a specific Task Specification.

*(Refer to `1_Onboarding_Guide.md` for the overall development workflow and `4_Global_Tooling.md` for specific tool commands and environment setup.)*

## 2. Core Technical Principles

* **Accessibility:** Strive for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance throughout the platform. Specific implementation guidelines are detailed in Section 5.
* **Mobile First Design:** Implement responsive design techniques with mobile viewports as the baseline. Details in Section 6.
* **Component & Module Isolation:** Design UI components (`src/components/`) and backend modules (when developed) to be well-encapsulated with clear interfaces.
* **Code Quality:** Adhere to SOLID/GRASP principles where applicable. Enforce standards via static analysis tools defined in `4_Global_Tooling.md`. Prioritize readability and maintainability.
* **Performance:** Optimize for fast load times and responsiveness using modern web techniques. Details in Section 7.

## 3. Project Architecture

### 3.1. Application Structure & Technologies

* **Primary Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS (v4), TypeScript.
* **Package Manager:** pnpm. (See `4_Global_Tooling.md` for usage).
* **Folder Structure:** Source code in `src/`, organized by features/components. Framework documentation in `RollingDocs/`. Operational task tracking in `RollingDocs/Tasks/`.
* **Component Areas:** Defined in `2_Project_Description.md`. Initially focused on **Frontend**. Technical approaches for future areas (Backend, API, Data Layer) will be added here as needed.

### 3.2. Key Architectural Decisions

* **Next.js App Router:** Utilize Server Components for static/server-rendered content and Client Components for interactivity.
* **State Management:** (Define strategy - e.g., Zustand, Context API, Valtio - if/when client-side state becomes complex). Initially rely on React state and Server Component data fetching.
* **Data Management:** Initial static data defined in `src/data/` using TypeScript interfaces. *(Future: Define strategy for API interaction, data fetching libraries (e.g., SWR, TanStack Query), database interaction, ORM, etc., as backend evolves)*.
* **API Design (Future):** Define conventions (e.g., RESTful, GraphQL) when APIs are developed.
* **Middleware:** Use Next.js middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) for cross-cutting concerns like routing adjustments, logging, or future authentication/authorization checks.

### 3.3. Design System Implementation

* **Methodology:** Follow Atomic Design principles (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms) for UI components in `src/components/`.
* **Styling:** Utilize Tailwind CSS utility-first approach.
* **Tokens & Theme:** Define design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.) within the Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.js`) and global CSS (`src/app/globals.css` or similar). Ensure light/dark theme support is implemented consistently.

## 4. Testing Strategy

* **Unit & Integration Tests:** (Define chosen framework - e.g., Vitest, Jest - and approach. Vitest was mentioned in original description but needs adding). Place tests alongside source code (`*.test.ts`).
* **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** (Define chosen framework - e.g., Playwright, Cypress - and strategy).
* **QA Process:** Mandatory QA checks (`pnpm project:qa`) defined in `4_Global_Tooling.md` must pass for all development tasks. Specific QA procedures detailed in `Roles/QA/Instructions.md`.

## 5. Accessibility Implementation (WCAG 2.1 AA Strategy)

* **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML5 elements (nav, main, article, aside, header, footer, etc.).
* **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and operable via keyboard. Maintain logical focus order. Implement visible focus indicators (see `4_Global_Tooling.md` for potential base styles).
* **ARIA:** Use ARIA attributes judiciously only when semantic HTML is insufficient to convey role, state, or properties.
* **Color Contrast:** Verify sufficient contrast ratios using browser dev tools or dedicated checkers.
* **Text Resizing:** Ensure content remains readable and functional when text size is increased up to 200%.
* **Forms:** Use proper labels, associate errors programmatically, ensure clear validation messages.
* **Images:** Provide meaningful `alt` text for informative images; use empty `alt=""` for decorative images.
* **Headings:** Maintain a logical heading structure (`h1` through `h6`).
* **Reduced Motion:** Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for animations.

## 6. Responsive Design & Mobile First Approach

* Apply base styles targeting mobile viewports.
* Use Tailwind's responsive modifiers (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`) to adapt layouts and styles for larger screens.
* Implement fluid typography and spacing scales.
* Ensure touch targets are adequately sized (e.g., min 44x44px).
* Test across common viewport sizes during development and QA.

## 7. Performance Considerations

* Leverage Next.js features: Server Components, code splitting, route prefetching.
* Optimize images using Next.js `<Image>` component or appropriate techniques for background images.
* Minimize client-side JavaScript bundle size; analyze bundles periodically.
* Implement efficient data fetching strategies.
* Consider caching mechanisms where appropriate (CDN, server-side, client-side).

## 8. Build & Deployment

* **Target Platform:** Vercel (Configuration in `vercel.json`).
* **Build Process:** Use `pnpm build` as defined in `4_Global_Tooling.md`.
* **CI/CD:** Leverage Vercel's automated deployment pipeline. Ensure mandatory QA checks are integrated or run prior to merging/deploying.
