# 2_Project_Description.md: Space Travel Booking Platform ðŸš€

## 1. Overview & Vision

**Project Goal:** To build and support a modern, accessible, cross-platform **Space Travel Booking Platform**.

**Theme:** "Dubai to the Stars â€“ The Ultimate Space Travel Experience"

**Vision:** Position Dubai as the worldâ€™s first hub for commercial space travel by creating a premier platform for booking and managing space journeys. This platform will serve as the primary interface for users interacting with our space travel offerings.

*(For the detailed technical strategy and architecture, refer to `3_Technical_Plan.md`.)*

## 2. Core Features (High-Level Scope)

The platform aims to provide the following key functionalities:

1.  **Trip Scheduling & Booking:** Allow users to browse destinations (space stations, lunar hotels, orbital locations), select departure/return dates, specify the number of travelers, and choose seat classes (e.g., Economy, Business, Luxury).
2.  **Pricing & Packages:** Display clear pricing for different trip configurations and offer curated travel packages combining flights, accommodations, and experiences (e.g., VIP zero-gravity).
3.  **Accommodation Information & Recommendations:** Provide details on available space accommodations (orbital stations, lunar hotels) and potentially suggest options based on user preferences or selected travel packages.
4.  **User Dashboard:** Offer a personalized portal for registered users to view and manage their bookings, see countdowns to launch, track loyalty status or rewards, and access travel information.

*(Specific features and their implementation details will be defined in individual Task Specifications (`TASK_...md`) located in `RollingDocs/Tasks/`.)*

## 3. Component Areas (Initial Definition)

The project will likely involve work across multiple component areas. Initially defined areas include:

* **Frontend:** User interface, user experience, component library, browser-side interactions.
* **(Future):** Backend/API, Database, Payment Gateway Integration, AI Recommendation Engine, etc. *(These will be defined further in the `3_Technical_Plan.md` as the project evolves.)*

Tasks will typically be scoped to one or more of these areas.

## 4. Guiding Principles

All contributors MUST adhere to these high-level principles:

* **Mobile First:** Design and implementation must prioritize smaller screen sizes and progressively enhance for larger ones. (See `3_Technical_Plan.md` for responsive design strategy).
* **Accessibility First:** Strive for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance in all aspects of the platform. (See `3_Technical_Plan.md` for accessibility strategy).
* **Code Quality:** Emphasize simple, concise, maintainable, well-isolated, and encapsulated code.
* **User Experience:** Focus on creating an intuitive, engaging, and seamless experience for the end-user.
* **RollingDocs Adherence:** Strictly follow the workflows, communication protocols, and documentation standards defined by the RollingDocs framework. (Start with `1_Onboarding_Guide.md`).
