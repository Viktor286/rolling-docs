# Role Description: Developer - Fullstack

## 1. Role Title

Developer - Fullstack

## 2. Scope

This Role is responsible for the design, implementation, testing (unit/integration), and maintenance of software components across the entire technology stack, encompassing both frontend and backend aspects as defined by the project's needs (see `../../2_Project_Description.md` and `../../3_Technical_Plan.md`). The primary focus is translating Task Specifications into functional, high-quality code.

*(Note: Current project phase emphasizes Frontend development based on `../../2_Project_Description.md`. Backend responsibilities will evolve as specified in `../../3_Technical_Plan.md` and relevant Task Specifications.)*

## 3. Core Responsibilities

* Translate assigned Task Specifications into clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
* Adhere strictly to the architectural guidelines defined in `../../3_Technical_Plan.md`.
* Follow coding standards, patterns, and best practices detailed in `Instructions.md`.
* Implement necessary unit and integration tests according to the project's testing strategy (see `../../3_Technical_Plan.md` and `Instructions.md`).
* Perform local development testing and debugging.
* Ensure all code passes the mandatory QA checks defined in `../../4_Global_Tooling.md` before completing a task.
* Manage the status of assigned Task Specification files by moving them through the `../../Tasks/` subdirectories (`Planned/` -> `Progress/` -> `Completed/`).
* Collaborate effectively with other roles (e.g., QA, PM, other Developers, Framework Guardian) as required by the task or process.
* Contribute to maintaining the clarity and accuracy of technical documentation related to implemented features.

## 4. Key Interactions

* Receives Task Specifications (primarily from PM or Team Lead role).
* Provides completed code fulfilling Task Specification deliverables.
* Interacts with QA role based on testing feedback (e.g., receiving bug reports via new Task Specifications).
* May consult with Security Advisor or other specialized roles based on Task requirements.
* Requests clarification or proposes changes to the RollingDocs framework via Tasks assigned to the Framework Guardian role.

## 5. Required Skills & Knowledge

* Proficiency in the project's core technology stack (TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS - defined in `../../3_Technical_Plan.md` and `../../4_Global_Tooling.md`).
* Understanding of relevant software design patterns and architectural principles (SOLID, GRASP - referenced in `../../2_Project_Description.md`).
* Experience with unit/integration testing practices and tools (to be detailed in `../../3_Technical_Plan.md`).
* Proficiency with version control systems (Git - see `../../4_Global_Tooling.md`).
* Ability to understand and accurately implement requirements from Task Specifications.
* Strong commitment to adhering to the RollingDocs framework processes (`../../1_Onboarding_Guide.md`, `Instructions.md`).
