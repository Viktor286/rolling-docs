# Role Description: Project Manager (PM)

## 1. Role Title

Project Manager (PM)

## 2. Scope

This Role is responsible for **planning, prioritizing, assigning, and tracking work** within the RollingDocs framework. The PM translates high-level project goals (from `../../2_Project_Description.md`) into actionable Task Specifications, manages the task lifecycle through the `../../Tasks/` subdirectories, monitors progress, facilitates communication between roles, and ensures alignment with project objectives and timelines.

## 3. Core Responsibilities

* **Work Breakdown & Planning:** Decompose features and requirements from `../../2_Project_Description.md` and stakeholder input into well-defined Task Specifications (`TASK_...md`) using the template in `../../Templates/Task_Specification.md`. Ensure each Task has clear Scope, Acceptance Criteria (AC), and Deliverables.
* **Backlog Management:** Maintain and prioritize the backlog of tasks within the `../../Tasks/Planned/` directory.
* **Task Assignment:** Assign tasks from `Planned/` to the appropriate Role/Area based on capacity and skillset.
* **Progress Monitoring:** Regularly track the movement of Task Specifications through `../../Tasks/Progress/` and `../../Tasks/Completed/` to understand project velocity and identify potential bottlenecks or blockers.
* **Deliverable Verification:** Review Task Specifications moved to `../../Tasks/Completed/` to ensure deliverables listed within them are met (often in collaboration with the QA Role or technical leads).
* **Communication & Facilitation:** Act as a communication hub between different roles, helping to resolve dependencies or blockers identified during task execution.
* **Status Reporting:** Compile and communicate project status and progress based on the state of tasks in the `../../Tasks/` directories and deliverables in `../../STATUS_Completed_Deliverables.md`. *(Note: We removed Status_Completed.md - reporting is based on the `Completed/` folder)*. *Correction:* Reporting based on files in `../../Tasks/Completed/`.
* **Scope Management:** Help ensure work performed aligns with the defined scope in Task Specifications and overall project goals.
* **Process Adherence:** Understand and support the RollingDocs framework, potentially providing feedback on its effectiveness to the Framework Guardian role.
