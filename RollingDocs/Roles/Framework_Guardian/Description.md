# Role Description: Framework Guardian

## 1. Role Title

Framework Guardian

## 2. Scope

This Role holds the primary responsibility for overseeing the **integrity, consistency, usability, and evolution of the entire RollingDocs framework documentation**. This includes all files and structures within the `../../` directory *except* for the `Tasks/` subdirectory and its contents (which reflect operational work, not the framework definition itself). The Guardian ensures the RollingDocs framework remains a clear, effective, and up-to-date guide for all project contributors (human and AI).

## 3. Core Responsibilities

* **Documentation Integrity & Consistency:**
    * Maintain accuracy, clarity, and consistency across all core RollingDocs documents (`0_About...` through `4_Global_Tooling...`, `Templates/...`, all `Roles/.../Description.md` and `Instructions.md`).
    * Ensure terminology, structure, formatting, and internal linking are consistent and correct.
* **Framework Change Management:**
    * Act as the gatekeeper for modifications to the RollingDocs framework documentation.
    * Receive, review, and process change requests (submitted as Task Specifications assigned to the Guardian role) for framework improvements, updates, or corrections.
    * Implement approved changes to the framework documents, ensuring changes are well-documented and communicated.
* **Role Definition & Maintenance:**
    * Define, document, and refine Role Descriptions (`Roles/.../Description.md`) and Instructions (`Roles/.../Instructions.md`) as the project evolves or new roles are needed.
* **Template Management:**
    * Maintain and update document templates within `../../Templates/`.
* **Onboarding & Support:**
    * Assist new contributors (human or AI) in understanding and navigating the RollingDocs framework.
    * Serve as a point of contact for clarifying framework processes or documentation ambiguities.
* **Process Improvement & Evolution:**
    * Proactively monitor the effectiveness of the RollingDocs framework.
    * Identify areas for improvement, simplification, or clarification in the process or documentation.
    * Propose framework enhancements by creating and potentially executing Tasks assigned to the Guardian role.
* **Process Adherence Monitoring (Optional - based on project agreement):**
    * Periodically audit adherence to key RollingDocs processes (e.g., correct Task file movement, QA check execution before completion) and provide feedback or suggest clarifications if deviations are found.

## 4. Key Interactions

* Receives Task Specifications for framework changes/updates from any role or human lead.
* Interacts with all roles to provide clarification on RollingDocs processes and gather feedback for improvements.
* Collaborates with Project Management (PM) / Team Lead roles to ensure the framework aligns with overall project goals and methodologies.
* Communicates significant framework updates to all relevant contributors.

## 5. Required Skills & Knowledge

* Deep and thorough understanding of the RollingDocs philosophy, structure, and workflow (as defined in `../../0_About_Framework.md` and `../../1_Onboarding_Guide.md`).
* Strong process thinking and analytical skills.
* Excellent technical writing and documentation skills; ability to write clearly for both human and AI audiences.
* High attention to detail and consistency.
* Proficiency with the project's version control system (Git) for managing documentation changes.
* (Optional) Understanding of software development lifecycles and project management principles.
